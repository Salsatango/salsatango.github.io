			<p> <span class="fish">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Dubbed "Sammy" by the fishermen who caught it, this is one of the only two wild Atlantic salmons caught last year. Sammy was caught three hundred miles off the shore of Nova Scotia, in September of 2048. You won't believe how much better tasting wild-caught salmon is compared to farm-raised. If kept in a refrigerated display case, this will impress your guests. if you want to eat it, we suggest serving salmon on sashimi or smoked. Sammy will be delivered to you frozen, in a refrigerated box. </p>

			<p> <span class="fish">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Mr.R was devastated when his elderly mother was taken by the great heatstroke of last summer. Although she didn't leave him much, he was surprised by a forgotten treasure hidden in the cupboards of her old appartment in Montréal: a set of three canned sardines. While the labels have been lost to time, the style of packaging indicate that these are a 2035 vintage, five years before sardines went extinct. While we don't know if the future holds anymore discoveries like this, we believe these are the last of their kind.</p>

			<p>  <span class="fish">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>We are proud to present to you the product of years of reseach. A few years ago, we found the last traces of #2bc7fffin tuna from the unlikelies of places. A strand of tuna sashimi was found stuck to the freezer rack of a Vancouver sushi restaurant. Last year, in a historic first, MacIntyre Biotechnologies succesfully extracted viable DNA from this piece of muscle tissue and engineered this animal. There hasn't been a #2bc7fffin tuna on Earth since 2030, when they were officially declared extinct. While we expect the price to go down as production capabilities grow, we are proud to offer this item at a reasonable price. </p>
